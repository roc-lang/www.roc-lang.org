# Documentation

- [builtins](/builtins) - docs for modules built into the language—`Str`, `Num`, etc.
- [basic-webserver](https://roc-lang.github.io/basic-webserver/) - a platform for making Web servers ([source code](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver))
- [basic-cli](https://roc-lang.github.io/basic-cli/0.19.0) - a platform for making command-line interfaces ([source code](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli))
- [plans](/plans) - current plans for future changes to the language

NOTE: The above uses Roc [alpha4](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/releases/tag/alpha4-rolling) (stable Rust compiler). Some of the syntax is deprecated and will not work with the new Zig compiler. If you would like to experiment with the unstable Zig compiler, you can try [this guide](https://gist.github.com/rtfeldman/f46bcbfe5132d62c4095dfa687bb9aa4).

In the future, a language reference will be on this page too.
