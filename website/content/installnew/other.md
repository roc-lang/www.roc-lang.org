# Other Systems

Note: if your system is in this "other" category, that means we did not test Roc on your system. The steps below may still work if zig works on your system.

1. [Build Roc from source](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/BUILDING_FROM_SOURCE.md)

1. Download and run hello world:

    ```sh
    curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roc-lang/examples/refs/heads/main/examples/HelloWorld/main.roc
    roc main.roc
    ```
